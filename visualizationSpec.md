## Features for *draw*

1. Animation of trajectories. [Would be cool to have ability to show repeated samples from ERP as a seris of animations with a paused between]. A related feature is arrows along the static trajectory line to indicate the direction of the path. 

2. Bigger numbers for the expUtilities. The current heatmap looks really good but numbers are hard to read. This might require a bigger grid when showing expUtilities. 

3. Ability to add the cell references ( [0, 1, ... , xLim ] under the x-axis and so on) is probably require for letting people play around with GridWorld. It'll also be helpful for us in using the visualization for developing gridworld inference examples. 

4. Optional coloring of terminals (not required -- but might useful).
